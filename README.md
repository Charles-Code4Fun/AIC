1. Decentralized Data Sharing
Data Marketplace: Create a blockchain-based marketplace where AI agents can share datasets securely. Each agent can upload data, and smart contracts can facilitate transactions, ensuring fair compensation for data providers.
Access Control: Utilize blockchain for managing permissions and access to datasets. Agents can control who can use their data through cryptographic keys.
